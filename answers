1. django-admin startproject company
   cd company
   ./manage.py startapp staff

2.

    class Employee(models.Model):
        employee_name = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='Employee_name', null=False, blank=False)
        department = models.ForeignKey('Department', related_name="department", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        email = models.EmailField(max_length = 150, verbose_name ='Email', null= False, blank= False)
        date_of_birth = models.DateField(verbose_name ='Date Of Birth', null= False, blank= False)
        picture = models.ImageField(upload_to ='pictures/', null= False, blank= False)
        def __str__(self):
            return self.employee_name

    class Department(models.Model):
        department_name = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name = 'Department Name', null=False, blank=False)
        manager = models.ForeignKey(Employee, related_name="employee", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank = True)
        def __str__(self):
            return self.department_name

4. ./manage.py test taff (it will run all test cases in that particular app)

7. To make models.py compatible with the form and view i had made email, date_of_birth and picture field as "null=True and blank=True"

8. deptlist.html is used to display departments list
   deptdetail.html is used to display detail view of particular department
   empForm.html is used for employee form submition 

   These files are placed inside staff app. We can also place templates folder at project area but for that we have to define path for templates in settings.py
